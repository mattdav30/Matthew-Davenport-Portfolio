# About Me

Hi, my name is Matthew Davenport. I am currently attending the University of Queensland studying a Bachelor's Degree in IT (BInfTech) Majoring in User Experience Design.

My expertise lies in User Experience Design, this includes prototyping, wireframes, front-end design, research and general design.
Apart from technical digital work, I have a keen interest working with others. I have experience in customer service, administration and general office duties.

I am proficient in using Wordpress and Squarespace, the Adobe Suite, filming, video editing, designing and creating graphics, and creating digital content. I also have experience growing large social media audiences and executing digital campaign strategies.
